farm seed interact with the world：
ideas:
1.grow consumables(potion,ammo(elemental),armor(shield),etc)  -- like making supply, but have a limit amount to carry
2.unlock guns permanently -- grow them or simply just drop(unlock) them from boss
3.grow monsters -- for example, there are kinds of chemicals that player can use to pollute the map(by dumping them into a river or sth), which gain monster's ability (difficulty,status,behaviors,rare drops,etc)

duarbility?：no. ammo is enough. Basically using guns.

flow - back and forth：
1. the idea of Dark Soul: 
for example, in two parallel path A-B-C and D-E-F (A,D are connected with the base), D unlock the path to B, B unlock E, so the player have to travel back and forth.
and the shortcut can make player travel easier after every death and have to go back to like scene C or F.  
However, this can also be easily solved by a teleport system.
2. dungeon style:
maps are not linear at all. Once you finish one map, it's done, unless the player want to farm seeds from them.
In this case players aren't forced to go through the same scene over and over.
But the reuse of the map is low.
Maybe randomize map? lots of work

enchant? craft?：
1. upgrade/enchant weapon(mostly guns) -- nice, but won't it contradict with the ammo? (since the ammo is already enchanted).
sample solution: 
a. enchant guns to adapt and use the special ammo. like add-on modified components. increase fire rate, fire range, etc.
b. seperate the upgrade for each kind of guns, like sniper, pistro, shot gun, lazer, rocket launcher.
c. limit the number of upgrade a gun can hold, so player have to choose the one they need the most and spend the material each time. Also have the upper limit for upgrading.

2. craft
ideas:
a. crossbreed seed -- ex: fire + ice bullet = streambust bullet (greatly increase bullet speed and fire range)
make player discover secret contents by their own.
same with other comsumables, like health potion + energy potion, etc
b.
